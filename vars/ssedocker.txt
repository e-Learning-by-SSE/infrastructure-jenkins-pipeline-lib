# SSE Docker DSL

```groovy
ssedocker {
  create {
    context 'directory/to/dockerfile/'
    target 'org/name:latest'
  }
  publish {
    tag '1.0.0'
    tag 'nightly'
  }
} 
```

**Parameter:**
- create: builds a docker image 
  - context [optional]: sets the directory for the dockerfile. Default is the current directory '.' 
  - target: specifies the target to built
- publish: publishes a docker image to github with ssejenkins access permissions
  - imageName [optional]: defines the image to be published. Is necessary when no `create` was called in beforehand. e.g. 'ghcr.io/org/name:tag'
  - tag [optional]: defines an additional tag to be published (the default from the target is always published).


**Example 2: Publishes a pre-built image**
```groovy
ssedocker {
  publish {
    imageName 'ghcr.io/org/name:latest'
  }
}
```
This publishes an image with the id 'ghcr.io/org/name:latest'. This image must be present on the system. 

**Example 3: Built and publish an image**
```groovy
ssedocker {
  create {
    target 'ghcr.io/org/name:latest'
  }
  publish {}
}
```
The Dockerfile must be locates inside the current workdir for this because we don't set a context. This will build an Image with the target 'ghcr.io/org/name:latest' and publishes it.
